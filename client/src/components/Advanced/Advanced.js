            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

            <img src="/images/shaman_aura.jpg" alt="Pablo Amaringo painting of a shaman" />

            <p>In this advanced section we are going to get deep into medicine. Before we start, please keep an open mind, because this information is going to be EXTREMELY different from what is taught in the West. To REALLY understand health and disease we need to cover a lot of topics, including the nature of reality, because ultimately we need to understand who we are, where we are, and how we create reality. THIS is the medicine of the plants, this is what they teach. This section will not be referenced. These teaching are from direct interaction with the plants and they do not conform to “scientific evidence” i.e. for some of the things I am about to share there exists no evidence within “science” simply because “science” itself, has been formed to suppress this type of knowledge, and focus entirely on the material world. The reasons for this we will get into very soon.</p>

            <p>We need to come to terms with the truth, no matter how “mind bending” it may seem, that what we think of as our everyday reality is NOT the truth of the universe. </p>

            <h3>UNDERSTANDING MEDICINE, REALITY, AND HOW THE PLANTS TEACH</h3>

            <img src="/images/alberto_icaros.jpg" alt="Shaman perfoming healing" />

            <p>I understand that just mentioning that “our everyday Western reality is VERY different to the reality of nature” – is not really very practical to let’s try to make this concept a bit more concrete. To give you a practical understanding of how the plants teach medicine, let’s talk about the process of shamanic apprenticeship in the Amazon. This is the training of the Medicine Man in a tradition that has a history of thousands of years.</p>

            <p>In Amazonian shamanism the apprentice learns medicine through the process of shamanic “dieting”. The following is a description of the process by a master Amazonian Shaman: </p>

            <div className="quote-block px-1 py-1">
              <p><i>“Shamanic dieting is the way that shamans in the Amazon apprentice and learn directly from the plant spirits themselves. It is a process that takes the participant out of ordinary reality into an altered state during the duration of the diet where communion of the plant or plants that are being dieted takes place. The plants are ingested in an infusion typically like a tea with water on the first night of the diet. Depending on the individual the plants will only be ingested that first time or on subsequent nights. The majority of the plants have little visionary effects and the learning takes place through the dream space, but often the dreams themselves seem little different than your normal course of dreaming. At first, the shamans
              say the learning process is invisible but then as you progress and learn to see more, the vibrant spiritual process is not only noticed but lived in the present time. You reach the point of working with the spirits you are dieting directly in this reality and many others.</i></p>

              <p><i>The diets are considered the pinicle of intensity for the apprentice. It is through pure intent that one completes the diet and bonds with the doctor spirit of the plant. Through that bond, the spiritual knowledge and healing abilities are passed.”</i></p>
            </div>

            <img src="/images/plant_diet.jpg" alt="Plant diet preparation" />

            <p>During the shamanic diets our whole concept of reality is broken down and rebuilt. We begin to realize that in the West we are born into an idea of reality that is not based on truth. We have SO many incorrect perceptions of the nature of reality and these misconceptions are passed down from parent to child in a never ending loop. We all “agree” on these misconceptions, and this further cements these falsities in the collective consciousness of the population.</p>

            <p>As soon as a Western apprentice undergoes the process of shamanic initiation, the plants start the task of breaking down these false perceptions that we have erroneously formed since birth, and rebuilding them back up with the truth of nature.</p>

            <p>Up until this moment, we could have spent most of our life believing in a understanding of life that is simply not true, but because it’s the only thing we have ever known and everyone else also has this false understanding then we BELIEVE this to be true...but it simply isn’t.</p>

            <p>So the process of healing, is really breaking down all these misconceptions and replacing them with truths.</p>

            <h3>GOING DEEPER</h3>

            <img src="/images/deeper.jpg" alt="Pablo Amaringo Ayahuasca Painting" />

            <p>Once we understand that the body is not just a machine, and that our mind, emotions and spirit have an effect on the physical body then to further our knowledge we have to take the next step in our understanding of life. As we continue to take the medicine and the plants continue to teach us, our consciousness increases to higher frequencies and our perspective on life is widened dramatically. We then get into deeper levels of medicine which encompasses far more than just physical medicines for our body. What I mean by this is that our understanding of medicine changes, and we realise that medicine is a synonym for TRUTH. Our quest for knowledge moves away from healing the symptoms of disease and towards the nature of life itself.</p>

            <p>As our consciousness expands we begin to see that the world is absolutely NOT as we thought it was, and here is where we get into what most people term “conspiracy theories”. This is a delicate subject, especially in the times we are now living, as this information is hotly debated on social media, and is currently being censored in an extreme way.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately the simple fact is that we live in a highly manipulated version of reality, one which is far from the nature of reality taught by the plants, and understood by the Medicine Man. The manipulators in this scenario label any talk of this manipulation as “conspiracy theories” and censor any talk of the real nature of reality. There is a reason that powerful shamanic teacher plants such as Ayahuasca, Peyote, San Pedro, Teacher Mushrooms are made illegal in the West. It’s because the manipulators don’t want people to understand the truth of life and their true power. </p>

            <p>CAUTION: You don’t need to take the upcoming information as your truth. If you dismiss any talk of human manipulation as “conspiracy theories” and this information doesn’t resonate with you then please just don’t read anymore or watch the videos. That’s absolutely OK! Stop here with what you have learnt in the beginner and intermediate sections, and have fun taking the essence and experiencing a beautiful healing journey!</p>

            <p>...If you are still here, then please understand that I have made this education section of the website with the full intent of sharing EVERYTHING that the plants have directly taught me about medicine, or sources of information that I have been led to, and this DEFINITELY includes those subjects that are termed “conspiracy theories” - but this is my truth and this is the truth that I will share, because it’s the only one I can. As mentioned previously the majority of this information can NOT be backed up by “scientific evidence” because the majority of science ONLY measures the material world. I’m not going to beat around the bush, I’m just gonna go all out and say it like it is, and then provide you with additional resources for further reading. I truly hope this helps widen your consciousness and brings more medicine into your life!</p>

            <h3>WHO ARE WE AND WHERE ARE WE?</h3>

            <p>As many shamans and mystics have said over the thousands of years of recorded history - We are all that exists. We are infinite consciousness having an experience as human. This is what the plants teach. Everything is energy, everything in the universe is connected, we are all ONE consciousness.</p>
              
            <p>Right now, we are all participating in the “Earth Experiment”, which was an experiment to experience the transformation of consciousness/frequency inside a physical form. From a 3rd dimensional frequency, to a 5th dimensional frequency.</p>

            <p>This video by Lorie Ladd is the best explanation I have ever heard:</p>

            <div className="video-container">

          <div id="what-is-happening" className="py-2 mt-3">
            <h3>WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE PLANET RIGHT NOW?</h3>

            <p>As I previously mentioned, humanity has been manipulated. We need to understand this so we can expand our consiousness and begin to see what we have been living in. From this perspective we can break free of our old version of reality, which includes our manipulated version of health and disease.</p> 
            
            <p>This is information is highly contraversial, and I could have easily left it out of this section, but to truly understand who we are and what is going on, then we have to fully understand our situation, no matter how bizarre it may seem. The truth truly is stranger than fiction.</p>
            
            <p>From a healthcare perspective it is crucial to understand the manipulation of humanity because it answers so many questions as to why we have our current healthcare system. We begin to see that human's working on behalf on the manipulators through secret societies, have sought to infiltrate and shape all aspects of western society for their malevolent ends. We begin to understand why families such as the Rockefellers, purposely manipulated the health system in the West. Without the understanding of their true purpose we would be left pondering the motive behind such actions, and we would not have a expanded perspective on why "science" exists, why we have a "body = machine" paradigm, and why traditional remedies and all knowledge of human multidimensional anatomy is suppressed in mainstream healthcare, through "lack of scientific evidence".</p>

            <p>The truth is, for the past 2000 or so years humanity has been manipulated by a extraterrestrial race known as the Reptilians. They have been given many names and have been mentioned numerous times in ancient texts, and shamans all over the world talk about this mass deception of humanity. It has also been recently researched and talked about by numerous modern authors. I know this understanding is wildly different than what we have been taught since birth, but we have to understand that there is a HUGE amount of information about the universe e.g. the existence of extraterrestrials, that has been purposely hidden from us by our manipulators, to keep us suppressed in a very narrow perception of life. Powerful spiritual experiences that can be given to us by teacher plants such as Ayahuasca, blow this perceptual bubble, wide open, and we begin to really see way beyond our previous limitations.</p>

            <p>This second video by Lorie, is again a brilliant explanation of what is happening right now:</p>

            <h3>HOW DO WE CREATE OUR REALITY?</h3>

            <img src="/images/galaxy.jpeg" alt="Galaxy" />

            <p>One of the major misconceptions is how we create our reality. WE are infinite consciousness experiencing ourselves. We CHOOSE to have an experience as “human” and we incarnate into a physical form to experience life as an individual point of attention of the “self”. Our body is not solid, is appears solid because of the way the eyes decode waveform information and create a three dimensional hologram of information in our brain. The image of physical reality that we think we see “outside” is actually a holographic projection that is created inside the brain. We actually live a universe made up of energy or waveforms, and our body is pure energy or waveforms, everything is. The eyes decode waveforms into a physical image, which is actually an amazing and a beautiful way of experiencing energy.</p>

            <p>So how is our reality created? The vast majority of spiritual literature points to the “Law of Attraction” which extends the principle of resonance in physics, and says our vibration attracts to it waveforms that are of a matching vibration. We experience whatever our frequency/waveform is in resonance with. However, where the teachings of the plants and the spiritual literature differ is in the understanding of manifestation and “who” controls our vibration.</p>

            <p>The law of attraction literature states that our thoughts control our vibration. The plants teach something different however. The literature states that <i>“our”</i> thoughts control <i>“our”</i> vibration – who are they referring to? We would say, well...us. They are referring to me. But who we really are is infinite consciousness (the entire universe), which manifests the self (“I”) and everything else. So it’s not the self/ego/“I” that manifests. Who I really am manifests the Self and everything that "I" experience. So the plants say that we ARE creators of our reality, but not at the level of the self or the “I”. So therefore our (the Self's) thoughts DON’T create our reality.</p>

            <p>The plants teach that the self /ego does not have any control over what happens in our lives. It was never meant to have any control. It was designed to experience life, but somehow along the way, and probably during the manipulation of our perception by the Reptilians, we self-identified with the ego and because we assumed that the ego is who we are in totality then we also assumed that the ego must have control over our lives through our thoughts and actions. But as our consciousness and perception expands we see the bigger picture that the self is not who we are and is manifested by who we really are, infinite consciousness. “Life is living us, not the other way round”.</p>

            <p>The idea that the self creates reality, through thoughts, beliefs, wants and desires is a HUGE misperception and creates a whole host of incorrect thought patterns. This misconception runs deep through human collective consciousness and even people who are spiritually aware still do not fully understand the process, hence why we have so much talk of manifestation and the law of attraction.</p>

            <p>This passage from a fantastic book called “Shedding the Layers” by Mark Flaherty about his experiences with the plant medicine spirits and ayahuasca describes it brilliantly:</p>

            <div className="quote-block px-1 py-1">
              <p><i>“I spent so much time thinking life should be different, wishing it were different. My life was made up of regret, blame, guilt, shame, plans, hopes, fears, wants and desires. None of them have any bearing on what will happen. Life is living me, not the other way around. Just like the spirits said, all I have to do is let life flow through me and move in harmony with it.</i></p>

              <p><i>The knowledge that I’m not the one doing my life is tremendously liberating – all the energy I was exhausting by constantly fleeing from the present moment becomes available to enjoy what is happening, right here, right now. And there’s no better experience than Now – that’s all there is.</i></p>

              <p><i>Contrary to much of the spiritual literature that I’ve read, I realize the Mark does not create anything. Who I really am, my true nature, is Creation which manifests the Self i.e. Mark, and everything else. Therefore, everything happens just as it is meant to. Consequently, all of us will achieve exactly what we here to achieve. We cannot do otherwise. Which means failure is impossible, and we are always on the right path."</i></p>
              
            </div>

            <p>Mark mentions a great point which is a tool that I’ve used during my own spiritual learning, which is when you are delving into your thoughts and searching for the truth of life, whenever you find knowledge or a thought that is “tremendously liberating” then this thought will be true. Life is infinite peace, love, joy, happiness – so the thoughts which are the truth are relaxing, uplifting, loving etc. You can use this as a “litmus test” to discern which thoughts and beliefs of life are in resonance with the truth of the universe.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="py-2 mt-3">
            <h3>“IF WE’RE NOT IN CONTROL THEN WHATS THE POINT?”</h3>

            <p>The ego will definitely reject the idea that it’s not in control. This is a problem that comes from living our whole lives self-identifying with the “I”, We gave control to the ego, when in reality it never had any control. We <i>are</i> in control, we <i>do</i> choose what happens in our lives – just not at the level of the ego.</p>

            <p>So, the challenge, and probably the hardest challenge in our evolution, is to once again TRUST ourselves. Most of us would have had a moment early in our lives when we lost trust in ourselves. The problem is that we were programmed from birth to identify with the self, the “I” - “I am me”. Then when something traumatic happened to us that was beyond our control, we totally lost trust in our ability to “let go” and let our lives happen and go with flow. Instead we think that the only way to keep ourselves safe is to control our lives. From then on the ego takes control and we start to plan everything and control everything. But in reality – <i>we never had control</i>. Who we really are, chose the traumatic event as an experience to have, and everything else in our lives.</p>

            <p>The “Higher Self” is an aspect of us that incarnated into the physical form. The job of the higher self is to be the bridge between the two aspects of us: the whole and the individual – who we really are as infinite consciousness and the individual point of consciousness experiencing itself as the self. Who we really are as Infinite consciousness at the level of the Higher Self manifests our life and everything that the self “wants” is known by the Higher Self – it IS us.</p>

            <img src="/images/trust.jpg" alt="Heart chakra" />

            <p>So now we have to learn to LET GO OF CONTROL. Give control back to the Higher Self. TRUST ourselves again (but this time trusting the higher aspect of ourself which actually has control instead of trusting the ego which will fail because it didn’t have control, it was never designed to). This releases the burden from the self, and we can start to enjoy life fully without trying to control what happens. This release of control from the mind (ego) to the heart (higher self / infinite consciousness) is the path of our evolution in human form, right now.</p>

            <p>The belief that we (the self, “I”) control our lives, through our thoughts controlling manifestation, brings stress. It brings a burden, it brings worry that we might be in a vibration or thinking thoughts that attract something we don’t want (fear), it also brings desire and wants, and “trying” to attract and manifest what we desire. </p>

            <p>I’m not a fan of religion but the Buddhists may well be right when they say that the key to happiness is the release of wants, desires and attachment. If the truth is that the self doesn’t have any control over manifestation then holding wants and desires is pointless – because they may never happen! They may not be what WE (at a higher level) chose to experience (as the self) in this lifetime.</p>

            <p>Holding onto attachment of what we want to achieve in life or what we want to experience, only brings us out of the present moment and focuses our energy on the “future”. As the plants taught Mark, Life is living us, not the other way around. Who we really are, as infinite consciousness, is having the experience as us. So it makes sense that who we really are chooses the experiences. And as Mark says, this knowledge is “tremendously liberating”. We can finally LET GO of control, the self has no control, it never did. We can enjoy the present moment fully, without having to think about the future, plan the future or worry about the future EVER. It’s a pointless activity because we have NO control over it, we can just relax, let go and enjoy life, because there is nothing else we (the self) can do!</p>

            <p>To fully let go of control we need to come to the realization that EVERYTHING that happens to us is PERFECT.</p>

            <p>Worry comes from the misunderstanding of this exact point. We worry (project fear into the future) that something will happen that we don’t “want” to happen – be in reality, whatever happens to us is PERFECT to lead us exactly where we need to go.</p>

            <p>As you can see, this misunderstanding of the nature of reality, and consequently how manifestation works, leads to the negative thought of worry. As we shall see below, all negative thoughts are the consequence of an incorrect perception of the universe.</p>

          <div className="bg-secondary py-2 px-2 mt-3 br-10">
            <h3>WHY DO WE HAVE NEGATIVE THOUGHTS?</h3>

            <img src="/images/alberto.jpg" alt="Maestro Alberto Torres Davilla" />

            <p>All negative thoughts come from an incorrect perception of reality. The Amazonian shamans observe these thoughts and beliefs in the body as “crossed energy”. The process of “healing” then, is the “straightening” of this energy.</p>

            <p>This is the physical representation of transformation of the emotional or mental bodies. In other words, the physical straightening of the energy corresponds to the changing of thought patterns and beliefs from “crossed” or incorrect perceptions of the universe, to correct perceptions.</p>

            <p>The medicine spirits teach us about the true nature of reality and in doing so they dissolve any misconception which leads to dissolution of negative thought patterns and beliefs, "straightening" our energy.</p>

            <p>Remember, the experience of negative thoughts and the transformation to a true understanding of reality was just a choice that we chose to experience as an individual point of attention of infinite consciousness. Ultimately, we don’t need to “get” understanding or be “healed” because we, as everything that exists, are already healed and have infinite awareness. So we chose to experience healing, for the experience of healing.</p>

            <p>When you understand the truth of life then you can start to see that all negative thoughts were the consequence of erroneous beliefs that you acquired during your lifetime. Let us go deeper into some of the most common negative thoughts and we will see how they are the result of a misunderstanding or a narrow perception of the nature of reality.</p>

            <div id="emotions">
            
              <h4>FEAR</h4>

              <i>an unpleasant emotion or thought that you have when you are frightened or worried by something dangerous, painful, or bad that is happening or might happen</i>

              <p>As we begin to understand that everything that happens is perfect, then nothing can happen that is “bad”. When we understand that we are infinite consciousness, we NEVER die, who we really are can NEVER be harmed – then there is never any reason to fear ANYTHING including death. It is all just experience. Fear is a result of our incorrect perception of our true nature.</p>

              <h4>WORRY</h4>

              <i>to think about problems or unpleasant things that might happen in a way that makes you feel unhappy and frightened</i>

              <p>Worry as we have already mentioned, comes from the misunderstanding that there are events that can happen to us that are not perfect. The truth is that everything that happens to us is meant to be and IS perfect.</p>

              <p>There is no resistance to creation at the highest level because we are infinite consciousness and the entire universe IS us – we are ALL THAT IS. We do not provide resistance against ourselves! So from this level we chose our individual lives and everything we want to experience as an individual point of attention. So the journey is chosen and the self created to experience the journey with no knowledge of the upcoming journey! This is what makes it an authentic experience. We couldn’t have this same experience if the self was aware of all future events that have already been chosen by us at a higher level. Time does not exist outside of our minds, so past, present and future are all one, and future events have been chosen.</p>

              <p>I know that all events being “predetermined” is no fun for the self, because it likes to be in control. The truth is WE are in control, we do create our own reality, we can manifest ANYTHING we want, just not at the level of the self. Also events aren’t really predetermined because time is an illusion, so all events are chosen by us, but can only ever be chosen by us in the NOW as the now is all that exists!</p>

              <p>So why worry? The self isn’t meant to have control, it’s meant to experience. We have over identified with the Self and it’s caused a lot of false conceptions about the nature of reality. The universe is perfect and everything happens in a perfect way. It cannot be any other way. We cannot go down the “wrong path”, we cannot “fail” to achieve our life’s purpose. We chose what to experience, and we created the self to experience this. So the self just goes along for the ride. As Mark Flaherty says “Life is living me, not the other way around. Just like the spirits said, all I have to do is let life flow through me and move in harmony with it”.</p>

              <p>You see that worrying is pointless when everything that happens is perfect, and can only ever be perfect. So what is there to worry about when everything that can possibly happen is perfect and is exactly the way it’s meant to be?</p>

              <h4>GUILT</h4>

              <i>a feeling of worry or unhappiness that you have because you have done something wrong, such as causing harm to another person</i>

              <p>Guilt comes from the perception that we can do something to someone or ourselves that is “wrong” is someway, and that they are a “victim” to our actions. However, with the understanding that we now have, that every event is chosen and manifested by the individual, at the level of the Higher Self, a direct link to who we really are, then we can see that no one can do anything to anyone else that they haven’t already chosen. No one is a victim to our actions, so therefore we have no reason to feel guilty, we can never do anything “wrong”. This leads us onto victim consciousness.</p>

              <h4>VICTIMHOOD</h4>

              <i>the condition of having been hurt, damaged, or made to suffer, especially when you want people to feel sorry for you because of this or use it as an excuse for something</i>

              <p>This is the belief that we are a victim to circumstance or the actions of others. As above, this comes from the misconception of the nature of manifestation. At the highest level, WE chose everything we experience, and who we really are manifests the self (“I”) and everything that we experience. So nothing happens to us that we didn’t chose at a higher level. So we are never a “victim” and the whole concept is erroneous.</p>

              <h4>SHAME</h4>

              <i>A painful emotion caused by the belief that one is, or is perceived by others to be,       inferior or unworthy of affection or respect because of one's actions, thoughts, circumstances, or experiences.</i>

              <p>When we realize the true nature of reality, that we are infinite consciousness having an experience as an individual point of attention in a human body, then how can we possibly be “inferior” to anyone or “unworthy of affection or respect”? The mere notion is ridiculous. Everything is ONE, WE ARE ONE. No one is inferior or superior to anyone else because we are ALL ONE. We are the same infinite consciousness, so how can we be inferior or superior to ourselves, we are what we are? It makes zero sense. Also we are INFINITE LOVE. So how can we be “unworthy of affection” when we are infinite love itself! How can we be “unworthy of respect” then the person we are looking to for respect IS us, we are ONE.</p>

              <h4>ANGER</h4>

              <i>the feeling people get when something unfair, painful, or bad happens</i>

              <p>This is linked to victimhood. There are no events that can happen that are “unfair” or “bad”. EVERY event that happens is PERFECT and exactly how it should happen. Anger is a reaction to an incorrect belief of the nature of manifestation and creation of experience. We chose everything that happens to us.</p>

            <h3>FEELING NEGATIVE EMOTIONS</h3>

            <p>As part of our individual human experience in 3D consciousness we have chosen at this time to be born into a highly manipulated human collective consciousness. We have been programmed by a Reptilian consciousness that aims for total enslavement of humanity. We are in the process of awakening from this manipulated perception, to realize the situation that we are in, and to ascend from 3D consciousness to 5D consciousness and dissolve the forces of manipulation.</p>

            <p>So from this perspective, it’s OK that we feel these emotions. It’s OK to feel anger, guilt, fear etc – it’s a consequence of our manipulation. We don’t need to beat ourselves up for feeling these emotions (energy-in-motion). We have a lot of stored and stuck energies in our body that need to be released as part of our ascension. As our consciousness expands and we begin to see the truth of life and that we have made incorrect beliefs about life, then these “crossed” energies begin to straighten, we will release all the blocked and stored energies that corresponded to these incongruences. This is an energetic “purge”, and is a pivotal part of the healing process. We need to purge these stuck low frequency energies to make room for higher frequency energies to enter the body and transform our frequency from a lower state to a higher state, which we know as “healing”.</p>

            <p>We need to feel these emotions as they come up to be released through our bodies energetic system. We don’t want to hold onto these stored up negative emotions any longer. We can feel them, and release them. We also don’t want to fall into the trap of trying to “change” these emotions as they come up, and try to “positively think” our way to a “better emotion”. This just delays the processing of the emotion through the body, and can add to the accumulation of negative emotions in the body, that get stored to be processed at a later date.</p>

            <p>We should always fully feel whatever emotion is in our body, it’s just energy passing through our body. We have been programmed since childhood to not fully feel these emotions, with phrases such as “stop crying”. That’s not what we want to do. We NEED to fully feel every emotion so it can move through us and be released. </p>

            <p>Eventually, as we release the old stuck emotion, we will begin to feel new occurrences of the negative emotion less frequently.  As our new found perceptions and beliefs will no longer trigger that emotional response in us, because we simply won’t believe that anymore and therefore we won’t respond in that way. For example, we will no longer experience the anger associated with victimhood because we no longer have the belief of victimhood.</p>

            <h3>WHAT IS HEALING?</h3>

            <p>How does all this relate to healing? Well…..who we really are, chooses to experience itself as human and chooses to experience whatever it wishes to experience. We are everything that exists experiencing ourselves, and before incarnation we choose to experience in a human lifetime whatever we wish to experience. This includes disease. Now this may be hard to fathom but from this understanding we realise that we are never a victim. This understanding of manifestation dissolves victim consciousness. How can we be a “victim” to anything if everything that happens in our life has been chosen by us at the highest level of who we are? Answer: we can’t. Like so many other things, victim consciousness is born out of a misconception of the nature of reality.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, there is nothing to heal. WE are everything, we are whole. So how can we heal if we are already whole? We choose to experience healing, which is really a choice to experience moving from one frequency (which we call illness) to another frequency (which we call health). That is what we think of as healing. It’s just the movement from a lower frequency to a higher frequency. That’s it. We don’t need to heal, because we are already whole and there is nothing to heal, but we choose to experience the shift in frequency and call it “healing”, just as we choose everything else.</p>

            <p>People will say, I don’t believe it, why would someone choose to be born with an illness, or die as a baby from an illness. From this level of understanding it makes perfect sense though. It’s just an experience. Infinite consciousness decides to experience itself/ourselves as an individual point of attention and so incarnates into a physical form (or incarnates into a higher dimensional consciousness that then partially incarnates into a physical form) and chooses to experience dying very young from an “illness”. It’s a choice, like any other choice, it’s just an experience. We see death as a tragedy because we self-identify with the “I” and the perception of “what I can see is all that exists” and “there is only one life and death is the end”. These beliefs are from a very narrow perception of the nature of reality, and are the outcome of perceptual programming and manipulation by a 4th dimensional Reptilian race.</p>

            <p>“Healing” is just a choice, it’s just an experience.</p>

            <h3>WHAT ABOUT MEDICINE THEN?</h3>

            <img src="/images/ayahuasca.jpg" alt="Ayahuasca cooking over an open fire" />

            <p>Ok, so if there is no need to heal anything then why do we need medicine?</p>

            <p>As part of a human lifetime we can choose to experience a change in frequency, known as healing. Medicine exists so we can experience this change in frequency inside a physical form. They are our partners for this journey. We are everything that exists experiencing itself. If we choose to experience this transformation of consciousness then the medicines aid us in experiencing this. We don’t need to get more knowledge because we are everything that exists including all knowledge! But we can choose to experience an expansion of consciousness for the pure joy and delight of the experience, and we can choose to experience illness and healing, for the range of experience which that journey will give us.</p>

            <p>If we chose to experience “healing”, then the medicine will aid us in expanding our consciousness. The result will be a transformation of our misconceptions of life, and consequently a straightening of our energy and a purge of blocked and stored trauma/emotions that have been blocking our energetic system, and restricting our frequency.</p>

            <p>It not about expanding our consciousness and healing, to get somewhere – there’s nowhere to go because we are already there. We’re not going on a journey to get somewhere, we are going on a journey to <i>experience</i> the journey.</p>

            <p>The best thing about essences, is that even if we don’t understand the whole manifestation process, and we haven’t a clue what we have chosen (at a higher level) to experience in this lifetime – we can be sure that as soon as we start to take essences, we will start shifting our vibration to a higher frequency. This really helps with letting go of control of our lives from the ego. We may not know what’s coming in our life, but if we keep working with the medicine then our frequency can only rise, and we can rest assured that we will only create higher and higher frequency situations in our life or events that will enable us to release lower frequencies from our bodies in order to continue to rise. We won’t go “downhill” or experience lower frequency situations permanently. We will be on an “uphill” expansion of consciousness, and increase in frequency, and that’s a nice feeling!</p>

            <h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>

            <p>Life is a miraculous, beautiful, amazing journey! I don’t think we fully understand who we are and what life is – but we are going on a journey of self-discovery to experience ourselves and learn more and more about who we are. With each experience, we learn more about ourselves as infinite consciousness.</p>

            <p>Medicine from the earth, especially in essence form, can be our partners in this journey, and they have tremendous knowledge to share with us, they can help us experience healing if that’s what we have chosen to experience!</p>

            <p>This is why I love them, and I know you will too.</p>

            <p>If you have reached the end, thank you! Please email me your thoughts, no matter what they are, I would love to hear them! Also, please let me know if you would like to me to write more in this education section (link to contact us page)</p>
