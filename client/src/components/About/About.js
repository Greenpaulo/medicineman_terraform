      <h3>WHY ESSENCES?</h3>

          <p>From the age of 20 I was extremely interested in plant medicine and shamanism. My journey into medicine began in the Amazonian Rainforest in Peru in 2004. I spent 3 months in Peru experiencing medicine and part of this was the beginning of a traditional apprenticeship into Amazonian plant medicine. This was an life transforming experience working with Ayahuasca and the plant spirits at a relatively early age, and I fully intended to continue my apprenticeship in Peru to completion. However, that was not to be my path!</p>

          <p>On return to the UK, I spent some time trying to bring what I had learnt into the Western world. I realized that if I wanted to practice plant medicine in the UK, I needed to have some kind of qualification, so I undertook a degree in Herbal Medicine and came out with a first class honours degree – BSc Herbal Medicine in 2011.</p>

          <p>During my clinical practice as a student Herbalist I was introduced to the use of flower essences. I began to focus more and more on the spiritual side of plant healing. I wrote my final year dissertation on “Vibrational Medicine in Herbal Clinical Practice”. Vibrational Medicine is a blanket term which includes energy medicines, such as essences, spiritual healing etc.</p> 

          <p>Over the years my herbal practice moved away from herbal preparations of tinctures and dried herbs and towards a focus on essences. I still use tinctures and dried herbs but flower essences became my main plant preparation of choice. I was always searching for the best alternative I could find in the western world for the experience I had with the plant medicines in Peru, and in my opinion essences are the form of plant medicine that mirrors that experience.</p>
          
        <h3>THE CONTINUATION OF AN APPRENTICESHIP</h3>

          <p>As I look back on the last 10 years of working with essences, I realise that my apprenticeship with the medicine spirits never ended. The method of learning stayed the same, the only thing that changed was the setting and the plant preparation.</p>

          <p>Nowadays, I keep a journal of all insights that I have whilst taking an essence. The process of writing, aids in the direct “download” of medicine, in the form of truth and insight from the spirits.</p>
