      <p>Pacific Essences® formulates pure Flower, Sea and Gem & Crystal Essences as non-invasive, gentle and effective tools for healing. As the leading practitioners and pioneers of Energy Medicine®, we have over 30 years of experience producing, teaching and testing essences on individuals and in case studies.</p>

      <h3>What is an Essence?</h3>
      <p>Essences are a safe, easy to use form of Energy Medicine®. The remedies support rebalancing on the wholistic level, to achieve physical, emotional, mental and spiritual homeostasis.</p>

      <p>We call it energy medicine because in fact it is through the essences’ relationship and interaction with the energy systems (chakras and meridians) in the human being that healing occurs.</p>

      <p>Since the visionary work of Dr. Edward Bach in the 1930’s, the development and knowledge of flower essences has been expansive and exciting. Pacific Essences® has been a contributor to the continued growth of Energy Medicine®, with high quality, consciously prepared, flower, sea and gem essences.</p>

        <h3>How Essences Work</h3>

        <p>Current scientific research, including that of Japanese scientist Dr. Masaru Emoto has shown that water has a memory. Subtle, non-physical aspects, such as the Vital Force of flowers can be imprinted on water. In this way, the positive “memory signature” of a particular essence creates a vibrational shift back to a state of harmonious balance.</p>

        <p>The body has an innate intelligence to self-correct imbalanced or negative states, known as homeostasis in Western medicine. The essences, on a frequency level, facilitate this self-healing body wisdom by recalibrating the body’s energy systems - the Meridians and Chakras.</p>

        <h3>What are the ingredients?</h3>
        
        <p>Pacific Essences® do NOT contain any physical elements of the plant, animal, gem or crystal sources, instead their individual “frequency” is captured and stored in water. Alcohol or Brandy is used as a preservative with a dilution of 50% spring water, 50% Brandy (20% alcohol by volume).</p>

      <div className="bg-secondary mt-1 mb-2 py-2 px-1 br-10">
        <h3>How are they made?</h3>

        <p>The flower is placed into a crystal bowl filled with pure spring water. The bowl is kept in sunlight for a short while, up to a couple of hours, in order to transfer the vibrational energy of the plant to the water. In the case of a living creature like Whale or Dolphin, the water that the animal has passed through is collected. No animal is ever harmed in this process. When possible, we don’t harm the plant when making the essences. Rather than clipping a flower off, we prefer to dip the flower or submerge it for a short time in the spring water. The plant remains whole and living.</p>

      <h3>How are Essences used?</h3>

      <p>Typically taken orally, essences can be used directly from the stock bottle or prepared into a dosage bottle. The general rule for making a dosage bottle is to fill a clean, glass dropper bottle with a dilution of 25% alcohol/brandy (a preservative) and 75% water. Choose the purest water available. Add two or more drops from the stock essence bottle and shake gently. Label. Ready for use. Drops from the dosage bottle can be taken directly or in a glass of water. Alternately, replace the dropper bottle with a mister bottle for an external-skin spray.</p>

      <p>The daily dosage is individual, generally, 4 drops, 2-4 x a day or 11 drops morning and evening. Trust your intuition. Essences are completely safe and can be used as a single remedy or in combinations.</p>

      <p>Essences can also be used in the bath.</p>

      <p>For those with alcohol sensitivities, children and pregnant women, consider applying the drops topically anywhere on the skin or creating a spray to be used topically.</p>

        <h3>Are there any side effects?</h3>

        <p>The gift of essences is their ability to work on the subtle energetic levels, while triggering real wholistic change.</p>

        <p>Many people find that the gentleness of essence rebalancing is almost undetected. It is only with reflection that they notice that the negative state has dissipated and has been replaced with a return to their emotional/mental centre.</p>

        <p>They are safe to use in all situations and highly effective and immediate for children and animals.</p>

      <h3 className="mt-2">Current research</h3>

      <p>Recent testing with an energy measuring device in Japan show extremely high and consistent energy ratings for our combination essences. This means that energetically Pacific Essences® are pure energy from the plant source from which they are made with little or no influence from outside interference. Some of the categories of measurement included: Immune System, Vitality, Autonomic Nervous System, Manic Depression, Stress, Happiness, Fear, Despair, Loneliness, Shyness, Pressure, Mental Fatigue, Worry/Anxiety, Confidence, Concentration, Memory, and Free from Trauma.</p>
