      <h3>What are vibrational remedies?</h3>

      <p>Vibrational remedies are natural, energetic remedies made from a wide variety of substances. The most widely-used remedies of this type are flower essences and many homeopathics. Other vibrational remedies include animal essences, gem elixirs, and starlight elixirs.</p>

      <p>Vibrational remedies are characterized by their energetic nature -- each remedy contains the energetic imprint of the animal/flower/gem/star/etc from which it is derived.</p>

        <h3>How are Wild Earth Animal Essences made?</h3>

        <p>No animals are captured or harmed to develop these products. The essences are made during a ceremonial process in a wilderness area of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. This ceremonial process includes attuning with and invoking the spirit of the animal involved. The resulting liquid contains the energy of the animal but does not contain any animal parts.</p>

        <p>My deep connections with wild animals, with the Earth, and with Native Americans have all served to inspire the development of the very personal ceremony that I use to create the animal essences.</p>

        <p>Stan Grof, one of the pioneers of the transpersonal psychology movement over the past 40 years, says something very wise that seems fitting to share:</p>

        <p>"In a yet unexplained way each human being contains the information about the entire universe or all of existence, has potential experiential access to all its parts, and in a sense is the whole cosmic network, as much as he or she is just an infinitesimal part of it, a separate and insignificant biological entity."</p>

        <i>-- Dr. Stan Grof, Modern Consciousness Research and Human Survival, in REVISION, Vol 8 no 1, summer-fall 1985.</i>

        <p>It is this innate ability that each of us has, to connect with all aspects of creation, that allows me to do the work I do, in combination with my own personal experiences of the animals and the work I have done on my own personal healing journey.</p>

        <p>The prime ingredient involved in developing these remedies is the power of Intent. This is the creative building block of creation, and setting a clear intention to connect with a specific animal in the making of an essence is the fundamental first step.</p>

        <p>The ceremony itself is quite simple; an observer looking at the forest clearing where I work would not see a great deal going on. That's because the process of attuning to the spirit of the animal involved happens in a very quiet, meditative, and internal way. I first collect a small bowl of water from the stream nearbyand place it at the center of the clearing. I then step beyond the edge of the clearing, and I begin the ceremony by walking in a large circle -- approximately 100 meters in diameter -- around the clearing. I meditate as I walk in a series of ever smaller circles, until after about 15 minutes I find myself at the center of the clearing beside the bowl of water. Throughout the meditation, I connect and pray to the animal I am invoking, telling it that I am here to serve in this way if it wishes to share its gifts with humankind. By the time I reach the center of the circle I have touched a place inside me where the animal and I are one. At this time the I experience the energy of the animal finding its newest abode in the bowl of water at the center of the circle.</p>

        <p>During the meditation walk I may hold a small feather or hair sample to bring me into deeper physical contact with the energy of the animal. However, this sample is not placed in the bowl and is used solely for helping me attune to the energy of the animal. (The samples have been gathered without harming any animals.)</p>

        <p>When I feel that all is complete, I proceed to walk out in reverse from the way I came in, this time through a series of ever larger circles until I return to the edge of the largest circle where I began. As I walk these circles in reverse on the way out, I slowly feel my everyday state of consciousness and mind returning to me, and I am deeply grateful to have shared in the beauty of this experience.</p>

        <p>When I began developing these essences, I was amazed to see that they really work, and part of me is still in awe of the fact that remedies created by me in this way are truly effective. Yet feedback from around the world continues to affirm that these remedies are valuable to many people in their emotional and spiritual journeys, and for that I am grateful to be a part.</p>

        <p>When one takes an animal essence, it is the consciousness of the animal that interacts with our own consciousness. This interaction occurs in a gentle, supportive way.</p>

      <h3 className="mt-2">What else is in the essences?</h3>

      <p>Along with the energy of the animal, each essence contains distilled water and brandy (40%) as a vibrational preservative. Without the brandy, the vibration would quickly dissipate. (If you are alcohol sensitive, drops may be added to a cup of boiling water and the alcohol will quickly evaporate.)</p>

      <h3 className="mt-2">How much and how often do I take the essences?</h3>

      <p>There are many ways to take the essences, and you can experiment and do what feels right to you. We recommend taking 5-7 drops, 3-4 times per day, but not with food. Of course, you may take them more or less frequently if you wish. With vibrational remedies, it is best to take them more frequently rather than taking more drops at any given time. Taking more drops is not harmful, just wasteful. It is fine to take two essences at a time if you wish.</p>

      <p>Vibrational remedies may be taken in a variety of ways. You may take them orally, by diluting them in a small glass of water, or they may be taken directly under your tongue. They are also just as effective by adding them to a warm bath. The effects of the remedies are heightened by quiet reflection and meditation upon the animal's qualities.</p>
